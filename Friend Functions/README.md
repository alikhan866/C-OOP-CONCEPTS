## Friend Functions

1. A `friend function` of a class is defined `outside` the scope of the class

2. A friend function has the rights to access `all private and protected members of a class`

3. Prototype should be included in the body of the class but definiton should be outside

### Why we need friend functions ?

1. When class's private data needs to be accessed directly
without using object of that class

2.Operator overloading
